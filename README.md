# DFG - Linux Hands-on Homework

## Description

This repository contains hands-on tasks related to the Linux system, including file management, text processing, load testing, process management, and networking tools. Each task aims to deepen understanding of the use of commands and tools in Linux. For detailed explanations, you can refer to my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@zulfianarahmi4).

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tasks, make sure you have installed and configured the following:

- **Linux**: Linux installation on a virtual machine (VM) or physical device.
- **flog**: Used to generate fake logs.
- **stress**: Used to simulate CPU and memory load.

## Tasks

### Task 1: File Management

- Creating and managing directory structures, as well as handling files using basic Linux commands such as `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, and `mv`.
- Using commands like `ls`, `tree`, `cat`, and others to verify results.

### Task 2: Output and Text Manipulation

- Log and text manipulation, including the use of `awk`, `cut`, `grep`, `sed`, and others to extract and modify information in log files.
- Using tools like `flog` to generate fake logs and perform various text-based analyses.

### Task 3: Process Management

- Managing processes and monitoring resources using commands like `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `df`, `du`, `free`, as well as simulating load with `stress`.

### Task 4: Networking Tools

- Using networking tools like `ping`, `telnet`, `curl`, `netstat`, `iperf`, and `nc` to test network connectivity, download content, and check ports and network connections.
